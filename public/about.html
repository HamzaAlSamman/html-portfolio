<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Hamza Al Samman, a 21-year-old web developer from Syria.
   I'm currently studying artificial intelligence, which is the field of computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines and software. 
   I'm passionate about creating websites and web applications that are user-friendly, responsive, and dynamic. 
   I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some popular frameworks and libraries, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and React. 
   I also have basic knowledge of PHP and SQL for back-end development. 
   I enjoy learning new technologies and tools to improve my skills and expand my horizons. 
   In my spare time, I like to read books, watch movies, and play chess.
   You can check out some of my projects on my portfolio page, or contact me via email or social media. 
   I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges.
   Thank you for visiting my website!
